# RxBeach
> Chill with streams at the RxBeach

Welcome to the documentation of RxBeach! 

RxBeach is a toolbox for creating applications that uses streams to manage
state. This documentation is a work in progress.

## Prerequisite knowledge

Before you dive into this documentation, and start working on your application,
you should have a good understanding of the following:

1. The Model - ViewModel - View pattern
2. Observables and streams
3. Actions / Flux standard action / Redux

We recommend these articles to get a refresher on those subjects:

1. [In-Depth Overview of Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview/)
2. [Idiomatic Redux](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/series/idiomatic-redux/)
   (article series)

## Diving in

The side bar contains all the documentation articles. We advice you read through
all the articles under "Fundamentals" in the order they are listed, and then
read the articles under "Recipes" and "Techniques" as you need them.

Remember that all the functions from RxBeach are also documented with JSDoc.
Make sure to read that reference documentation as well. It should be available
through your IDE.

## Development

[The roadmap](roadmap.md) is an introduction to the goals and considerations
behind RxBeach, and also lists some of the planned features, with specs, that
are up for grabs.
